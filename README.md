**🗺️ DSA Travel Planner**

This is an academic project developed during my 4th semester. The DSA Travel Planner is a C++ based system that applies Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts to simulate a travel planning service.
It demonstrates OOP principles, file handling, graph algorithms (shortest path), and real-world problem modeling.

**🏗️ File Structure**
📂 DSA-Travel-Planner
 ┣ 📜 main.cpp              # Entry point (login, admin/customer handling)
 ┣ 📜 travelplanner.cpp     # Core logic (graph algorithms, shortest path)
 ┣ 📜 travelplanner.hpp     # Header file (class declarations)
 ┣ 📜 customers.txt         # Stores customer credentials
 ┗ 📜 README.md             # Documentation

🛠️ Tech Stack

• Language: C++

Concepts Used:

• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
• File Handling (for storing users)
• Graphs & Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra’s variation)
• Data Structures: vector, queue, unordered_map, priority_queue

**📸 Example Run (Console Output)**
----------Login----------
1. Admin Login
2. Customer Login/Sign Up


Customer chooses service:

Do you want to use our travel services? (Y/N): Y
Choose your preference:
1. Cheapest Route ($5)
2. Fastest Route ($10)


**Travel planner result:**

The total distance that has to be travelled is 12 kms.
The number of stops will be 2.
The path will be:
Lahore Railway Station --> Badshahi Mosque --> Faisal Mosque

**🎯 Learning Outcomes**

✔️ Applied DSA concepts to a real-world system
✔️ Implemented shortest path graph algorithms
✔️ Practiced file I/O in C++
✔️ Strengthened OOP principles in a modular project
